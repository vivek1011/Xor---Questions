XMAX spoj - find maximum XOR over all the subsets 
XORSUB - has to take one value and find maximum over all the subsets.
XORSACK (IPC) - check if a subset exists with given XOR . 
all based on same strategy- try to maximise the msb set in all cases using vector[bit] .

Find no of ways of having Given Xor(over all subsets)- dp[ith position tak][particular Xor] = no of ways.
